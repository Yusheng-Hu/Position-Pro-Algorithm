# Position Pure Algorithm

Official implementation and interactive visualizations of the **Position Pure (PP)** linear-time ranking/unranking algorithm.

### 🚀 Evolution of Efficiency: Beyond Heap's Algorithm

The **Position-Pure Algorithm** and **Circle-Permutation-Algorithm** represent a paradigm shift in combinatorial generation by optimizing the fundamental cost of state transitions.

* **Heap's Algorithm (The Classical Baseline):** Long considered the gold standard due to its *swap-based* approach. While swaps were once thought to be the minimum-cost operation, they involve multiple memory accesses and conditional logic that limit peak performance.
* **Ives' Iterative Algorithm:** Improved upon Heap's by utilizing a *single-shift and single-assignment* pattern, reducing the overhead of element movement.
* **Position-Pure Algorithm (Our Work):** Achieves a new frontier by **eliminating conditional branching** and implementing a highly refined *shift-and-assign* strategy. 
    * **Scalability:** Optimized for large $N$.
    * **Concurrency:** Stateless design allows for massive **parallel execution**, a feat traditional recursive algorithms cannot achieve.
* **[Circle-Permutation-Algorithm](https://github.com/Yusheng-Hu/Circle-Permutation-Algorithm) :** Specifically engineered for circular symmetry. While it introduces controlled spatial overhead, it shatters traditional performance barriers by realizing an **O((n-1)!)** complexity framework.

#### **Key Insights**
* **Significant Speedup:** `permPure_full` consistently outperforms Heap's Algorithm by a factor of approximately **7x**.
* **Algorithmic Efficiency:** The performance gap highlights the superior memory access patterns and lower computational overhead inherent in the PositionPure algorithm.
* **Scalability:** As the permutation space grows factorially, the performance gap remains stable, demonstrating excellent algorithmic efficiency for large-scale generation.

## 🚀 Full Permutation generation: Iterative Permutation Generation

The **PositionPure** algorithm is a high-performance, iterative approach to generating all permutations of a set. By utilizing an iterative state machine rather than traditional recursion, it significantly reduces function call overhead and optimizes CPU branch prediction efficiency.

The algorithm utilizes an **iterative state machine** to eliminate recursion overhead and leverages **hardware affinity binding** via the Windows API to minimize context-switching noise, with performance verified to nanosecond-level accuracy through **high-precision benchmarking**.

## 🚀 Comparison with Python's Built-in itertools

At the request of Reddit users and other community members, a performance comparison with Python’s built-in `itertools` was conducted. Results are based on the implementation in `Position-Pure-Algorithm/python/pp_iter.py`.

* **Runtime Environment**: The tests were performed using **PyPy3**. Since the standard `itertools` library is C-optimized, using PyPy3 helps bridge the low-level language gap, allowing for a more authentic comparison of algorithmic efficiency.
* **Results**: Benchmark tests show that this algorithm improves performance by at least **1.4x**, with potential gains reaching over **2x** compared to the standard library.
* **Future Plans**: For applications requiring even higher performance, a **C-compiled version** should be considered.

## 💡 Future Ideas & Extensions

### 1. Zero-Memory "Lazy" Permutation
Since we can determine any value at position `k` in O(N) time without generating the full array, we can implement a **Lazy-Loaded Permutation Object**. 
- **Use Case:** Accessing elements of a massive permutation (N > 10^6) that exceeds RAM capacity.
- **Concept:** Overload `operator[]` to call `PP_get_value_at_position(k)` on the fly.

### 2. SIMD-Accelerated Partial Search
The backward-tracing logic `if (C[i] == current_target_pos)` is highly vectorizable. 
- **Idea:** Use AVX-512 to scan 16 elements of `C` simultaneously.
- **Goal:** Achieve near O(1) perceived latency for individual element lookups.

### 3. Distributed Constrained Search
Leverage the independence of the `get_value` function to split a single permutation validation task across multiple CPU cores or network nodes without shared state.

## 💡 Why Position Pure?
The **Position Pure (PP)** algorithm provides a more intuitive $O(n)$ implementation compared to the classic Myrvold-Ruskey (MR) method:
* **Simpler Indexing**: Replaces the traditional swap-based unranking with a direct mapping logic.
* **Educational Value**: The provided visualizations make the complex mapping process easy to understand.

---

## 📄 Academic Status
* **Preprint**: need long time.
* **Status**: $O(n)$ complexity achieved, improving upon the classic Myrvold-Ruskey logic.

## 📢 Important Update: From "Position Pro" to "Position Pure"

**Please note:** Starting from version **v1.1.1**, this algorithm has been officially renamed from **Position Pro** to **Position Pure (PP)**.

### Why the name change?
1. **Trademark Consideration:** We found that "Position Pro" is a registered trademark in several industrial and commercial sectors. To ensure the algorithm's academic independence and avoid legal confusion, we have transitioned to a unique name.
2. **Technical Essence (Why "Pure"?):** The name **"Pure"** more accurately describes the algorithm's technical implementation. In computer science, "pure" often implies a clean, branchless execution flow. 
3. **Core Feature - Branchless Logic:** Unlike the base version, **Position Pure (PP)** achieves its linear-time performance through direct element-wise shifting and replacement. **It eliminates conditional branching (no `if` statements in the core loop)**, leading to a "purer" and faster execution path on modern CPUs.
